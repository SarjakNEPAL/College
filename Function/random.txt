it's datas is unpredictable
for example captchas, and cards etc //not relevant take as example only

to use we need:
import random

print(dir(random))
print(random.random())
float value is returned

for rand range :
     randrange(1,8)
     it return integer

for random.uniform

    we supply 2 arguement start and end, last value is end-1 and retuns answer in float same like randint but is float

for random suffle
    it changes position of list and gives new list
    eg we have 
    a=[1,2,4,5,6]
    random.suffle(a)
    print(a)
    the position is changed
