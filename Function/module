2 types:
{
    
    predefined: the modules available in python. no need to write codes from  scratch
                the methods available in the module must be imported
                for eg: to use randint function we need to import random 
    
    userdefined: made by user. where there can be function, classes, and etc, it will help in code reusability 
                for eg we need to import a sum function from a file to another file name signin
                then source code:
                in login.py{

                    def sum(x,y):
                        print(x+y)
                    }

                    if we need to block some in the module to get execute 
                    source code:
                        if __name__ =="main":
                            sum(10,20)

                    in signin.py:
                    {
                        import login
                        login.sum(10,20)
                    }
