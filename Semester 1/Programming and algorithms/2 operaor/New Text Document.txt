We should write comment to explain our code. and know the purpose of code. This is required when we have gaps in our projects. 
comments doesnot allocate memory and is not printable. 

LED project
- 4 members 1 leader
- use github 
make a repo in github 
work division like frontend and backend, git management, and all. use comments and doc string. 



docstrings: when we need to describe and a module or function. we do this to explain the function . uses ''' ''' (triple quotation). use inside the function. 
to display this print(add.__doc__)


/ gives quotient in float. if we need specific number of decimal character use round function
		a=1.2345
		print(round(a,2))
% remainder
** gives power
// gives integer quotient


i=i+1
i+=1 is same

== gives bolean value

	AND operator-
	OR operator-
	
bitwise Operators
	the operations are performed in bitwise 
& operator

^ XOR operator


Positive number->
	binary --> truth table --> 1s -->2s
Negetive number->
	binary->1s->2s->truth table
