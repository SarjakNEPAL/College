When you need to repeat a block of statement, loop is used.

basic stucture is
1 initialization -> condition -> increment | decrement

for example: 

displaying the name 10 times using Loop

For loop


:/> range() is used to generate a sequence of number
{
    for example 
    range(10)-> if single value is started then the initial value is 0 and step is 1 and the last value is 9
    range(0,10)-> if two is given, first is initial value and last is the ending point
    range(0,10,2)->same as above but the last value is the step
}

for loop:
    syntax:
        for <variable> in <sequence>:
            <statements>

example:
    i=0
    for i in range(10):
        print("Raj")
